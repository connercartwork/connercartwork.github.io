                <p>Changeling is a Narrative Mystery VR game that is currently in development using the Unreal Engine and will be fully released sometime in the next few years. I worked on this project during the summer of 2023 for an internship, and as such only worked on it for three months. I was tasked with being a composer and sound designer for the game, where I created and implemented numerous musical tracks for different sections of the game. I created music for three sections of the game, being the Father’s Level, the Mother’s Level, and the street, as well as some smaller tracks to be used in numerous different sections. In Changeling VR, you play as Aurelia Walker, a detective with the ability to read the thoughts of people upon physical contact with them. One day, you receive a call from Angela Summers, where she explains something isn’t quite right with her baby. From there, you are tasked with entering the minds of each family member in order to fix their problems and find out what is troubling the youngest child.</p>

The prurpose of this game is to provide a multiplayer experience to teach people the importance of putting themselves in someone else's shoes, and would act as a more invovled and entertaining substitute to traditional diversity training.

                <p>Blue Beetle Boost is a singleplayer endless runner that focuses on upgrading your vehicle and avoiding obstacles. It was made using Unity and C#, and was developed at RIT by a development team of five people. I was the team leader, and therefore set the direction of the art and gameplay production, while myself primarily working on the sound design / music with some additional work in the code. As Harry Dresden, you’re responsible for driving three wardens all the way from Chicago to Montezuma in the less than reliable Blue Beetle. The car has never been in a consistently stable condition, and it’s not up to snuff today either. As you drive along, you’ll be picking up coins to spend on upgrades to make the Blue Beetle more durable, go further distances, and ultimately reach Montezuma and beyond in a single trip. This game is built around the Dresden File novels. *Note that cover art is a mock-up, the game was not released for the Nintendo Switch*</p>

I was the team leader, and therefore set the direction of the art and gameplay, while myself primarily working on the game’s code and different levels. In the game you play as one of many Warlocks in the world of Ethshar. Like all Warlocks, your power is granted by the Source, and as long as you’re careful not to abuse your power it asks little of you in return - until now. The Final Calling has begun, and Warlocks from all over the world are making a pilgrimage to the Source. You will travel through treacherous mountains, overcome puzzles, and surpass the fallen Warlocks along the way in order to finally make your way to your final destination. This game is built around the world of Ethshar and the novels by Lawrence Watt-Evans. *Note that cover art is a mock-up, the game was not released for the Nintendo Switch*</p>

It was made using Tabletop Simulator, and was developed by a team of five people at RIT. I was the team leader, and therefore set the direction of the art and gameplay, while myself primarily working on the board creation and the implementation of assets. You play as a spellcaster for hire, trying to make it big in the world. All you have is your magic, a bit of coin, and your wits. You aren’t the only one trying to get rich, however, and your fellow players will be right there with you, interfering with your plans, and causing general mischief. Travel around Ethshar as the spellcaster of your choice, collecting money and trying to make ends meet. This game is built around the world of Ethshar and the novels by Lawrence Watt-Evans.</p>

Lucky for you, you're armed with your trusty food bucket, which you can use to throw food at the oncoming animals as they approach you. These animals include the Rhinos who will charge right by, and the kangaroos who will bounce right back. Be careful, as the animals only get faster and more abundant as the animals catch word of your food bucket. How long can you last before the animals steal your bucket?</p>

It was made using Visual Studio and C#, and was developed by a development team of four people. I was primarily in charge of the combat system, and served as a designer, producer, and programmer. You play as a successful jazz musician, Jaz Zee, on his quest for some ancient sheet music rumored to be hidden in one of the runes of the Muze Desert. Unfortunately for him, the desert he finds himself in is incredibly dangerous, and it might prove more of a challenge to get this treasure than he thought. Run through the ruins of the land and either avoid or combat the Desert Dwellers that make their home there. Prepare yourself, as it’s very unlikely this treasure was left unguarded...</p>
